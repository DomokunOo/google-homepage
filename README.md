I recreated the google homepage working with HTML and CSS.
I was able to recreate all the transitions, hovers, focus, styling, box shadow, visited, links, buttons.
I used icons from Font Awesome for the img/button that was not available.
Colors were close to matching as well as spacings using flexboxes.


Search function does not work but that is not the purpose of this project.

CSS code can be better organized with comments for each section, inherited properties can be reorganized a bit and reduce duplication of code. HTML code can be grouped in many different ways. I could minimize code or use a variety of tags that better represent the elements/items.
